Two basic fun games in Excel.

There are two tabs, each containing a different variation of a game where the goal is to turn all tiles in the grid from red to green.  Instructions are in each tab.  First, select a level by pressing the "Select Level" button.  Then select the desired tile and press the "Play" button to change the color of the selected tile and its neighbors.  Press the "Cheat" button to see a winning sequence of cells, and "Uncheat" to hide the sequence.
